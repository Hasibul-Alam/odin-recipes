    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      Biryani (/bɜːrˈjɑːni/) is a mixed rice dish originating among the Muslims
      of the Indian subcontinent. It is made with Indian spices, rice, and a
      meat form (chicken, beef, goat, lamb, prawn, fish or eggs). Vegetarian
      versions of the dish replace meat with vegetables such as potatoes.[1]
    </p>

    <p>
      Biryani is one of the most popular dishes in South Asia, as well as among
      the diaspora from the region. It is also prepared in other parts of the
      world such as Iraq.[2] Biryani is the single most-ordered dish on Indian
      online food ordering and delivery services.[3][4]

    <h2>Instruction</h2>
    <h3>For the Beef Curry/Masala</h3>
    <ol type="1">
      <li>
        In a pressure cooker pot, heat oil and add the thinly sliced onion.
        Saute until the onion is golden brown.
      </li>
      <li>
        Once the onion is golden, add the beef cubes along with the ginger
        garlic paste. Saute on high heat until the beef changes color.
      </li>
      <li>
        Now add the tomatoes, yogurt and the whole spices (cardamom, peppercorn,
        cloves, and salt).
      </li>
      <li>Also add the Shan Biryani Masala.</li>
      <li>
        Cook on high heat, while constantly stirring for about 5-7 minutes. Add
        2 cups of water, the beef should be submerged in liquid.
      </li>
      <li>
        Now cover the pressure cooker pot with its lid and bring to pressure.
        The cooking time will vary from 5-10 minutes depending on the cut of the
        beef and also the size of the beef pieces. The beef I used took about 10
        minutes to cook through.
      </li>
      <li>Now add the cubed potato.</li>
      <li>
        Cook the beef on high heat, stirring frequently until excess liquid has
        evaporated and the oil has separated from the curry. Also the cubed
        potato should be almost cooked through too.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <h3>For the Rice</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Now in another large pot, bring water to a boil and add the rice, cumin
        seeds, lemon, chopped mint, oil and salt. Cook the rice until it is
        parboiled (3/4 cooked). Drain the rice in a colander.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <h3>For Assembling</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        In a separate large pot, layer half of the rice. Then add the beef
        curry, and top with sliced lemon and chopped coriander.
      </li>
      <li>Cover with the remaining rice.</li>
      <li>
        Drizzle over the milk, and some yellow food colouring mixed with water.
      </li>
      <li>Drizzle with melted ghee or butter.</li>
      <li>Sprinkle more chopped coriander and lemon slices if desired.</li>
      <li>
        Cover and steam cook on low flame for 8-10 minutes until the rice is
        fully cooked.
      </li>
      <li>Mix the biryani carefully and serve with raita.</li>
    </ol>
